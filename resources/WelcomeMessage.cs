/* 
Thank you for using "C# Playground"!
Make sure to have the "Editor > Inlay Hints: Enabled" (editor.inlayHints.enabled) 
property set to "on" in your settings to get inline values 
of your global variables and console outputs

NOTE: 
- Only global variables, i.e. variables declared at the top level, 
    will have their values displayed inline
- All code has to be placed here in Program.cs, 
    types can NOT be declared in separate files
